DISEASES AND THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE RANGES:-

(A litle research goes on to suggest that temperature is not a very narrow division)

1. Bronchitis

- Fever, Temperature ranges above 99.6
- However not all cases lead to a fever
- Fever depends person to person especially in people with different immunities against disease
- Fever, persistent cough, and difficuly in breathing
- Severe cases can also lead to body temperature going above 100 degree fahreneit
- Rhonchi, Wheeze and Crackling

2. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)

- Fever, Temperature above 99.4
- Not all cases lead to a fever
- group of progressive lung diseases, includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
- Fever, shortlesness of breath, change in colour or amount of mucus produced
- quite serious and requies immediate medication and surgical attention
- Rhonchi, Wheeze and Crackling

3. Pneumonia

- Serious Fever, Temperature above 100.4
- Inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs leading top it getting filled with fluid
- Again, may not be accompanied by a fever
- Immune system releases pyrogens
- Often accompanied by other symptoms such as cough, chest pain, shortness of breath,
  and fatigue
- Wheeze and Crackling

4. Epiglottitis

- Very high fever, 101 to 103
- Inflammation of the epiglottis, a flap-like structure at the base of the tongue that prevents food from entering the windpipe (trachea)
- Severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing, drooling, and high fever
- Medical emergency, especially in children
- High fever, difficulty breathing, drooling, and a high-pitched sound during inhalation (stridor)
- Immediate medical attention is required
- Hib vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of epiglottitis caused by Hib bacteria
- Wheeze, stridor

5. Laryngomalacia

- Fever, 100.4 and above
- Congenital condition where the tissues of the larynx (voice box) are soft and floppy, leading to partial airway obstruction
- Primarily associated with symptoms related to breathing and feeding difficulties. Infants with laryngomalacia often make a characteristic noise, known as stridor, during breathing
- Changes in behavior, breathing patterns, or signs of illness, including fever
- stridor

6. Cystic fibrosis

- Quite high Fever, 101.1 and above
- Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems
- Leads to the production of thick and sticky mucus that can clog the airways and cause breathing difficulties
- Individuals with CF develop respiratory infections, such as bacterial or viral lung infections, they may experience symptoms like fever, cough, and increased mucus production
- Can signal the need for medical evaluation and possible treatment with antibiotics or other therapies
- Crackling

7. Heart Disease

- Mostly can lead to anxiety, stress which leads to low temperatures below 97.4
- Hearts ability to pump blood effectively is compromised which can lead to fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body
- Symptoms such as shortness of breath and swelling.
- Can potentially affect the bodys ability to regulate temperature, especially in advanced stages where circulation and fluid balance are severely impaired
- Certain heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation, can cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort
- Only a healthcare professional can accurately diagnose and address the underlying cause
- Wheeze, Crackling
