# Audio Processing Web Application
# Overview

This web application allows users to perform audio processing operations on a WAV file, including amplification, filtering, and denoising. It provides a user-friendly interface to upload a WAV file from the device storage, process the audio, and visualize the results.

The project is implemented using Python for backend processing, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and MySQL for storing patient details and logs. Flask is used as the web framework to seamlessly integrate these technologies.
# Features

    Audio Processing:
        Amplification: Adjust the amplification level of the input audio.
        Filtering: Apply a customizable filter to the audio.
        Denoising: Remove noise from the input audio.

    Graphical Representation:
        Display amplitude vs. time graphs for both the input and output audio.
        Play the recorded audio to compare the differences between the original and processed versions.

    Patient Details:
        Collect patient details before processing the audio.
        Maintain a patient log with relevant information.

    Log Viewing:
        View a log of all processed patients, including their details and processing history.
        Easily navigate through the log for reference.

# Technologies Used

    Backend:
        Python with Flask for server-side processing.
        MySQL for database management.

    Frontend:
        HTML for page structure.
        CSS for styling.
        JavaScript for dynamic behavior and interactions.

# Usage

    Upload WAV File:
        Navigate to the home page and upload a WAV file from your device storage.

    Patient Details:
        Enter patient details like name,mobile number,address and gender before processing the audio.

    Audio Processing:
        Click the "Submit" button to initiate the processing.

    Graphical Representation:
        Visualize amplitude vs. time graphs for both input and output audio.
        Play the recorded audio to compare the differences.

    Patient Log:
        View the log page to see details of all processed patients.
